# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Build and fix a Flutter personal finance mobile application with complete transaction management, account handling, category system, and reporting features.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Flutter/Dart with Riverpod state management, SQLite database, Android target platform
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with separation of domain entities, data models, repositories, and use cases
- **Core Features**: Transaction recording (income/expense), account management, category system with search/create functionality, budget tracking, work location logging, financial reports
- **Build Command**: `flutter build apk` generates release APK at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- **Installation**: `adb install -r [apk-path]` installs on connected Android device
- **Main Issue**: Fixed "Bad state: No ProviderScope found" errors by properly implementing Riverpod providers
- **Recent Fixes**: Resolved category selection by implementing searchable/createable category selector, fixed transaction saving with visible confirmation buttons

## Recent Actions
- **Provider System Fix**: Replaced mixed Provider/Riverpod usage with consistent Riverpod implementation using ProviderScope
- **UI Improvements**: Added explicit "CONFIRMAR Y GUARDAR" button for transaction saving, improved error messaging
- **Category System Enhancement**: Implemented searchable category selector that allows creating new categories on-the-fly
- **Account Management**: Created complete account handling system with dedicated screens and CRUD operations
- **APK Generation**: Successfully built and deployed updated APK to Android device after multiple iterations
- **Debug Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive logging and error handling throughout the application
